Data::Localize::Format::Sprintf - Format strings using regular sprintf

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Data::Localize;
	use Data::Localize::Format::Sprintf;

	my $loc = Data::Localize->new;

	$loc->add_localizer(

	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an extremely simple module which lets you use sprintf syntax in your
translation strings.

Using this formatter has following advantages:

=over

=item

this format is widely known so you don't have to learn it

=item

it's a single sprintf call, so it is bound to be faster than any custom
solutions

=item

it lets you use full range on characters (unlike Maketext formatter, which
currently doesn't let you use square brackets)

=back

Please note that sprintf also lets you specify the number of parameter which
you want to use with syntax C<%1$s>, C<%2$s> etc.
